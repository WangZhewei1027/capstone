      - generic [ref=e4]: "Concept: Graph (Directed vs Undirected)"
      - generic [ref=e5]: This interactive module demonstrates the difference between directed and undirected graphs through hands-on construction, visualization, and live adjacency representations (matrix & list). Create nodes and edges, toggle the graph mode, and observe how edge directionality changes adjacency, degrees, and visuals.

        - strong [ref=e8]: Learning Objective
        - generic [ref=e9]: "After interacting with this module, you will understand: - The visual and structural difference between directed and undirected edges. - How edge orientation affects adjacency matrix symmetry and degree calculations (degree vs in-/out-degree). - How the same set of nodes can represent different connectivity depending on directionality."
      - generic [ref=e10]:
        - strong [ref=e11]: Interaction Design
        - generic [ref=e12]: "- Click anywhere in the graph area to add a node. Nodes are draggable. - Enter \"Add Edge\" mode, then click a source node and a target node to create an edge. In directed mode an arrow is created (source → target); in undirected mode a single undirected edge appears. - Toggle the \"Directed\" switch to see all edges update their appearance and how the adjacency matrix/list changes. - Select a node to inspect its degree (undirected) or in-/out-degree (directed). Clicking adjacency matrix cells toggles edges. - Visual feedback: edges animate when created, arrowheads fade in for directed edges, table cells briefly flash on edge toggles, and connected edges highlight on node selection."
      - generic [ref=e13]:
        - strong [ref=e14]: Layout Description
        - generic [ref=e15]: "- Safe area margins: 24px around the viewport (enforced by body padding). - The module uses a two-column layout: left is the interactive graph canvas (flex:1), right is the controls panel (fixed width ≈360px). - Minimum spacing of 16px between interactive elements (implemented via CSS variables). - Accessibility & responsiveness: clear focus states, large enough touch targets, keyboard-compatible controls for toggles/buttons, and a responsive single-column stacking on narrow screens."
