      <h1>K-Nearest Neighbors</h1>
      <p>There are several popular machine learning algorithms for k-nearest neighbors, including K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees.</p>
      <h3>K-Nearest Neighbors</h3>
      <p>The K nearest neighbors algorithm is based on finding the set of k closest points to each other. It works by calculating the distance between two points using their Euclidean distances, and then selecting the k closest points as the new points.</p>
      <p>Here's an example implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in JavaScript:</p>
      <code>
        function knnDistance(p1, p2, k) {
          var d = Math.sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) ** 2 + (p1.y - p2.y) ** 2);
          if (k == 0) {
            return 0;
          } else if (d < k * k) {
            return d;
          } else {
            return knnDistance(p1, p2, k - 1);
          }
        }

        var points = [
          { x: 4, y: 2 },
          { x: 6, y: 3 },
          { x: 8, y: 5 },
          { x: 10, y: 7 },
          { x: 12, y: 9 },
          { x: 14, y: 11 },
          { x: 16, y: 12 }
        ];

        var k = 3; // number of nearest neighbors
        var closest = knnDistance(points, [points[0], points[1]], k);

        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm returned " + closest;
      </code>
