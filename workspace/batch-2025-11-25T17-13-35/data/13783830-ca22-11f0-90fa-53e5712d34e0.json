It works by calculating the distance between two points using their Euclidean distances, and then selecting the k closest points as the new points.</p>\n      <p>Here's an example implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in JavaScript:</p>\n      <code>\n        function knnDistance(p1, p2, k) {\n          var d = Math.sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) ** 2 + (p1.y - p2.y) ** 2);\n          if (k == 0) {\n            return 0;\n          } else if (d < k * k) {\n            return d;\n          } else {\n            return knnDistance(p1, p2, k - 1);\n          }\n        }\n\n        var points = [\n          { x: 4, y: 2 },\n          { x: 6, y: 3 },\n          { x: 8, y: 5 },\n          { x: 10, y: 7 },\n          { x: 12, y: 9 },\n          { x: 14, y: 11 },\n          { x: 16, y: 12 }\n        ];\n\n        var k = 3; // number of nearest neighbors\n        var closest = knnDistance(points, [points[0], points[1]], k);\n\n        document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = \"The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm returned \" + closest;\n      </code>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>"
