    <h1>Binary Search</h1>
    <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the potential locations to just one.</p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        1. Begin with the middle element of the sorted array.<br>
        2. If the value of the middle element is less than the target value, narrow your search to the upper half of the array.<br>
        3. If the value of the middle element is greater than the target value, narrow your search to the lower half of the array.<br>
        4. Repeat the process until the target value is found or the subarray size becomes zero.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
    <pre>
function binarySearch(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = length(array) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) / 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        else if array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>The time complexity of binary search is <code>O(log n)</code>, making it much more efficient than a linear search, especially for large datasets.</p>
