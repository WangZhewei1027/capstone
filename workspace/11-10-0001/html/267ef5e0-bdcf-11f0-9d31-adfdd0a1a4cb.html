Concept Title:
Divide and Conquer — Visualizing recursive splitting and merging (merge-sort style)

Learning Objective:
After interacting with this module, users will be able to:
- Understand the core idea of divide and conquer: recursively break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve each, and combine their solutions.
- See how a problem (array) is split into subranges and how merging combines sorted subranges.
- Trace the recursion order (calls and returns) and relate it to visible changes in the data structure.

Interaction Design:
- Input & Controls:
  - A numeric array input (comma-separated) and a "Randomize" button to create test arrays.
  - Play/Pause button to run an automatic animation of the divide-and-conquer process.
  - Step Forward / Step Back buttons to navigate one recorded step at a time.
  - Speed slider to adjust animation duration.
  - Reset button to return to the original array.
- Visual Feedback:
  - The array is shown as horizontal bars. Bar height represents value; the bar label shows the number.
  - When a recursive call "splits" a range, that range's bars are outlined and colored (split highlight).
  - A recursion-call panel (call stack / tree-like list) displays active ranges (e.g., [0..7]) in the order calls are made; the currently executing call is highlighted.
  - During "merge" steps, bars move (animated) into their merged positions and colors change to indicate the copy/merge operations.
  - The UI animates bar positions and heights using CSS transitions for smooth motion. Buttons and slider provide immediate response and accessible focus outlines.
- How this reinforces understanding:
  - The split highlights show the "divide" phase — ranges get smaller until base cases.
  - The recursion-call panel shows the order of calls and returns (helps map time to the call tree).
  - Merge animations show how results of subproblems are combined into larger sorted ranges, demonstrating "conquer" + "combine".

Layout Description:
- Safe area: the whole layout uses 24px padding on all sides of the viewport to meet the safe area margin requirement.
- Overall structure: a responsive two-column layout on wide screens and stacked layout on narrow screens:
  - Top: Title and one-sentence objective.
  - Main area (flex container with gap 24px):
    - Left (visual stage, flexible): array visualization area with bars, and beneath it a compact status line that indicates current step and stage (Split/Merge).
    - Right (controls column, fixed min-width): form controls (input field, randomize, Play/Pause, Step Back/Forward, Reset, speed slider) arranged vertically with at least 16px spacing between interactive elements. The recursion-call panel is below controls, scrollable if long.
- Spacing and accessibility:
  - Minimum spacing between interactive controls is 16px (implemented via gap and margins).
  - Controls are keyboard-accessible; elements have accessible labels (label elements and aria attributes).
  - Color choices use clear contrast for highlights; focus outlines are preserved.
- Responsiveness:
  - On narrow screens, the right column stacks below the visual stage; layout uses flexbox and media queries to adjust.
  - Bar sizes and container scales with available width; values remain readable.

Implementation:
Below is a self-contained HTML/CSS/JS module (no external libraries or assets). Copy into a .html file and open in a modern browser.
