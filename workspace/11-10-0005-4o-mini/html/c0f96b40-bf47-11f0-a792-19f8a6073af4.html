**Concept Title:** Exploring Binary Search Tree (BST)

**Learning Objective:** 
After interacting with this module, users should be able to understand how a Binary Search Tree (BST) works and how to perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal on a BST.

**Interaction Design:**
1. **Insertion Operation:**
   - Users can input a value into a text box and click an "Insert" button to add the value to the BST.
   - Upon insertion, the BST will visually update to reflect the new value being added.
   
2. **Deletion Operation:**
   - Users can input a value to delete into a text box and click a "Delete" button to remove the value from the BST.
   - Upon deletion, the BST will visually update to reflect the removal of the specified value.
   
3. **Traversal Operation:**
   - Users can click on a "Traversal" button to see different types of tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder) animations to understand how these operations work on a BST.
   
4. **Visualization:**
   - The BST nodes will be visually represented in a tree-like structure on the screen.
   - Visual cues like colors, lines, and animations will help users understand the structure and operations on the BST.

**Layout Description:**
- The interactive elements like text boxes, buttons, and traversal controls will be neatly organized in a logical flow on the page.
- The BST visualization will be centered on the screen to draw the user's focus.
- Clear labels and instructions will guide users on how to interact with the BST.
- Adequate spacing and consistent styling will enhance readability and usability.
- The design will be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes while maintaining clarity and functionality.

Code Implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be provided in the next steps.
