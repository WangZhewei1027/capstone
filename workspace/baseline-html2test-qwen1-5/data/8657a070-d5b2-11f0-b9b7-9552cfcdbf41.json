If the current element is greater than the current element at its previous position, then the smaller element will be moved to its correct position in the array. This process continues until all elements have been sorted.</p>\n    \n    <div id=\"array\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>"
