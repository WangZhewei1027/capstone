If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, we add it to the sorted list. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, we subtract it from the sorted list.</li>\n\t<li>The final sorted list contains all the elements in the original array that are greater than or equal to the previous element.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>This example shows how to use the topological sort to sort an array of numbers: 4, 3, 2, 1, 5. The topological sort will give us the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\nTopological sort is a simple and efficient data structure that can be used for sorting arrays efficiently. It provides a way to sort elements based on their distance from each other without having to know the exact order of the elements."
