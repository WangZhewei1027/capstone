    <h1>Topological Sort</h1>
    <p>Topological Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array of elements based on their relative order in the input array.</p>
    <p>The algorithm works by iterating over each element in the array and comparing it to the current element at its current position in the array. If the current element is greater than the current element at its previous position, then the smaller element will be moved to its correct position in the array. This process continues until all elements have been sorted.</p>
