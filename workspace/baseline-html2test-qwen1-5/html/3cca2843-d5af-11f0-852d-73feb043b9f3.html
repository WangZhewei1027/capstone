Here is an example of a simple linear search algorithm implemented in JavaScript:
```
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
  let start = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == target) {
      return i;
    }
    
    start = i + 1;
  }
  
  return -1;
}
```

This function takes two parameters: `arr`, which is the array to search through, and `target`, which is the value to find. It uses a loop to iterate through each element in the array starting from the first element (`start = 0`). If it finds the target value at the current index, it returns that index. If it reaches the end of the array without finding the target value, it returns `-1` to indicate that the target value was not found.
You can use this function like this:
```
const arr = [3, 2, 8, 5];
const target = 4;

console.log(linearSearch(arr, target)); // Output: 2
``` 

In this example, the function is called with an array `[3, 2, 8, 5]` and a target value of `4`. The function returns the index of the second element in the array that matches the target value, which is `2`.
