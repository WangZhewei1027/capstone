<h1>Hash Map Example</h1>

<p>This is a simple hash map.</p>

<p>The key-value pairs in this map are stored as key-value pairs. Each time a new key-value pair is added to the map, it is added to the list of key-value pairs associated with that key.</p>

<p>The following is an example of how you can access a value from a hash map:</p>

<p>The key "key1" is associated with the value "value1". The following is an example of how you can access a value from a hash map:</p>

<p>The key "key1" is associated with the value "value1". The following is an example of how you can access a value from a hash map:</p>
