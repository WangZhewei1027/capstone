**Concept Title:** Explore Binary Search Trees (BST)

**Learning Objective:** By interacting with this module, users will understand the concept of Binary Search Trees (BST), how they work, and how to perform basic operations on them.

**Interaction Design:**
1. **Add and Remove Nodes:** Users can interact by clicking on the 'Add Node' button to input a value and add a node to the Binary Search Tree. They can also remove a node by clicking on the 'Remove Node' button and entering the value to be deleted.
   
2. **Search for a Node:** Users can search for a specific node by entering a value and clicking on the 'Search Node' button. The node will be highlighted if found.

3. **Visual Representation:** As nodes are added, removed, or searched for, the Binary Search Tree will dynamically update on the screen to reflect these changes. Nodes will be visually represented with animations to show how the tree is structured.

**Layout Description:**
- The interface will have a clean and minimalistic design with clear labels and buttons for user interaction.
- The Binary Search Tree will be displayed visually on the screen, with nodes connected through lines to represent the hierarchical structure.
- User input fields for adding, removing, and searching for nodes will be neatly arranged with proper spacing for ease of use.
- Visual cues such as highlighting nodes or animating transitions will provide feedback to users about the actions they perform.

By following these design principles, the module will offer an engaging and informative experience for users to explore Binary Search Trees interactively.
