It works by iterating through the array and comparing each element with its previous one. If the current element is smaller than the next one, it is moved to the correct position. The algorithm continues this process until the entire array is sorted.</p>\n    \n    <script>\n      function insertionSort(arr) {\n        let len = arr.length;\n        \n        for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {\n          let key = arr[i];\n          let j = i + 1;\n            \n          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];\n            j--;\n          }\n          \n          arr[j + 1] = key;\n        }\n        \n        return arr;\n      }\n      \n      console.log(insertionSort([3,6,8,2,9])); // Output: [2, 3, 6, 8, 9]\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>"
