    <h1>Insertion sort</h1>
    <p>The insertion sort algorithm is an efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly placing the smallest element so far in the array, then moving on to place the next element in the order. It works by iterating through the array and comparing each element with its previous one. If the current element is smaller than the next one, it is moved to the correct position. The algorithm continues this process until the entire array is sorted.</p>

      function insertionSort(arr) {
        let len = arr.length;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
          let key = arr[i];
          let j = i + 1;
            
          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
          }
          
          arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
        
        return arr;
      }
      
      console.log(insertionSort([3,6,8,2,9])); // Output: [2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
