    <h1>Binary Search Tree (BST)</h1>
    <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that maintains sorted order, allowing for efficient search, insert, and delete operations.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each node has at most two children.</li>
        <li>The left child of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.</li>
        <li>The right child of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.</li>
        <li>The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Operations</h2>
    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>To search for a value <code>v</code>, start at the root and recursively or iteratively check left or right subtrees based on the value of <code>v</code>.</p>

    <h3>Insertion</h3>
    <p>To insert a value <code>v</code>, follow the search path, inserting it as a leaf in the appropriate position.</p>

    <h3>Deletion</h3>
    <p>Deleting a node involves three cases:
        <ol>
            <li>The node is a leaf - simply remove it.</li>
            <li>The node has one child - remove the node and replace it with its child.</li>
            <li>The node has two children - find the node's in-order predecessor or successor, swap values, and delete the predecessor or successor.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
