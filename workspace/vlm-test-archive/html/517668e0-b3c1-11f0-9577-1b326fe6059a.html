    <h1>Topological Sort</h1>
    <p>
        Topological Sort is an algorithm used to order the vertices of a directed graph so that for every directed edge <code>U -> V</code>, vertex <code>U</code> comes before vertex <code>V</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scheduling tasks in a way that prerequisites are satisfied.</li>
        <li>Determining the order of compilation tasks in programming.</li>
        <li>Representing dependencies in various scenarios like build systems or project management.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Compute the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.</li>
        <li>Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to a queue.</li>
        <li>While the queue is not empty, do the following:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove a vertex from the queue and append it to the topological order.</li>
            <li>For each of its neighbors, decrease their in-degree by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If the topological order does not contain all vertices, then there is a cycle in the graph.</li>
    </ol>
