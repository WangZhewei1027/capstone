    <div class="graph-type">
        <h2>Directed Graph</h2>
        <p>A directed graph (digraph) is a graph where the edges have a direction. 
           Each edge is represented as an ordered pair of vertices.</p>
        <p>Example: A -> B, B -> C</p>
    </div>

    <div class="graph-type">
        <h2>Undirected Graph</h2>
        <p>An undirected graph is a graph where the edges have no direction. 
           The edges are represented as sets of vertices.</p>
        <p>Example: A - B, B - C</p>
