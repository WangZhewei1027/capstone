    "content": "To create a Red-Black Tree in JavaScript, you can use the built-in `TreeNode` class from the `Node` module. Here is an example of how to create a red-black tree using this code:\n\n```javascript\nvar root = new TreeNode(0);\nroot.left = new TreeNode(1);\nroot.right = new TreeNode(2);\nroot.left.left = new TreeNode(3);\nroot.left.right = new TreeNode(4);\nroot.right.left = new TreeNode(5);\nroot.right.right = new TreeNode(6);\n\nconsole.log(root); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `TreeNode` object called `root`, which represents the root node of the tree. We then add four more nodes to the tree by assigning them values to their children using the `left` and `right` properties.\n\nThe resulting tree will have the following structure:\n\n```\n   0\n / \\\n  1   2   3   4\n/ \\  \\\n5   6   7\n```\n\nWe can access the value of each node using its index (0 through 5), as shown in the output above."
