To create a binary search tree (BST), you need to define two data structures: an array of nodes and a function that performs the BST search.

Here's a simple implementation of a binary search tree using JavaScript:
```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

class BST {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  insert(val) {
    let current = this.root;

    if (val < current.val) {
      current = current.left;
    } else if (val > current.val) {
      current = current.right;
    }

    if (current === null || val === current.val) {
      return current;
    }

    return this.insert(val - current.val);
  }

  search(val) {
    let current = this.root;

    while (current!== null && val <= current.val) {
      current = current.left;
    }

    if (current === null || val > current.val) {
      return null;
    }

    return this.search(val - current.val);
  }
}
```

In this implementation, we define two classes `TreeNode` and `BST`. The `TreeNode` class represents a node in the BST, having a value and two child nodes (`left` and `right`). The `BST` class represents a single node in the BST, which has a root node (`root`) and two child nodes (`left` and `right`). We also define a `insert` method that takes a value as input and inserts it into the BST. The `search` method searches for a given value within the BST and returns the index or null if not found.
You can use these classes to create a binary search tree by calling the `insert` or `search` methods on the root node. For example:
```javascript
const BST = new BST();
BST.insert(3); // insert 3 into the BST
console.log(BST.search(1)); // print "1" to the console
```
