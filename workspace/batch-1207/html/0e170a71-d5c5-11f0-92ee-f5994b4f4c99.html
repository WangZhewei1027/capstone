Here is an example of a simple bubble sort algorithm implemented in JavaScript:
```
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr[i] - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        // swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
        let temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}
console.log(bubbleSort([3,6,8,9])); // Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

This function takes an array as input and iterates through it using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element in the array, while the inner loop iterates from the second-to-last element to the last element in the array. If any element is found that is greater than its adjacent element, it is swapped. After all elements have been processed, the function returns the sorted array.
You can call this function with your own array as an argument to sort it. For example:
```
bubbleSort([3,6,8,9]);
```

The output will be `[1,2,3,4,5]`, which is the sorted version of the array `[3,6,8,9]`.
