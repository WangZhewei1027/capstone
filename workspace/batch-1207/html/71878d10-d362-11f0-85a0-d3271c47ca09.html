To create a Red-Black Tree in JavaScript, you can use the built-in `TreeNode` class from the `Node` module. Here is an example of how to create a red-black tree using this code:

```javascript
var root = new TreeNode(0);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(2);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(5);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(6);

console.log(root); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, we create a new `TreeNode` object called `root`, which represents the root node of the tree. We then add four more nodes to the tree by assigning them values to their children using the `left` and `right` properties.

The resulting tree will have the following structure:

```
   0
 / \
  1   2   3   4
/ \  \
5   6   7
```

We can access the value of each node using its index (0 through 5), as shown in the output above.
