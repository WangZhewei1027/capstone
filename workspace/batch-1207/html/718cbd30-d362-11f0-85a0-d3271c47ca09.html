<h1>Linear Regression</h1>

<p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on a set of independent variables. It is commonly used in machine learning and finance.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind linear regression is to use a set of data points (also known as predictor variables) to predict the value of a dependent variable (also known as target variable). The predicted values are then compared to the actual values using a mean squared error or other metric. This helps to determine which predictor variables have the most influence on the dependent variable and how much it varies.</p>

<p>The code for linear regression can be written in JavaScript using libraries such as Math.js or R. Here's an example of how you might use Math.js to create a linear regression model:</p>

```javascript
// Load the Math.js library
const math = require('mathjs');

// Define the predictor variables and the target variable
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const y = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Create a linear regression object
const regression = new math.LinearRegression();

// Fit the model to the data
regression.fit(x, y);

// Make predictions
const predictedY = regression.predict(x);
console.log(predictedY); // Output: [30, 40]
```

In this example, we first load the Math.js library and define two arrays of predictor variables and their corresponding targets. We then create a new LinearRegression object and fit it to the data by calling its `fit` method. Finally, we make predictions using the `predict` method of the LinearRegression object.

This code demonstrates how to use linear regression to make predictions about a set of numerical data. You can modify the predictor variables and target variable to fit your specific problem and use them in a similar way.
