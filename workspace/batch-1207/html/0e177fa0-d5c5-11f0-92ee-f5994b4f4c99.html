<h1>Selection Sort</h1>

<p>The Selection Sort algorithm works by repeatedly selecting an element from unsorted elements and placing it in its correct position within the sorted array.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Start at the beginning of the array and work your way to the end.
    <li>Move the first unsorted element to the end of the array.
      <li>Move the second unsorted element to the left of the first unsorted element.
        <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until all elements have been moved.
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
