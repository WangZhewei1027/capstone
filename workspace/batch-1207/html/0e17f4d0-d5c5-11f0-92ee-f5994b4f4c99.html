Sure, here's an example of a quicksort algorithm implemented in JavaScript:
```javascript
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  
  pivot = arr[Math.floor((arr.length / 2) * Math.random() + 1)];
  left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot];
  middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot];
  right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot];
  
  return quickSort(left) + middle + quickSort(right);
}
```

This function takes an array as input and recursively sorts it by partitioning it into three sub-arrays based on a random pivot element. The `Math.floor` function is used to ensure that each sub-array has an equal size.
Here's an example usage of this function:
```html
const arr = [4, 2, 9, 6, 1, 3, 5];
console.log(quickSort(arr)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
```

In this example, the `quickSort` function is called with an array `[4, 2, 9, 6, 1, 3, 5]`, which is then sorted using the partition operation. The resulting array is then printed to the console using the `console.log()` method.
