<h1>Binary Search</h1>

<p class="description">Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted array or list.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

```
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // If no element found at the given position
}
```

<h2>Example</h2>

```
let arr = [3,6,9,1,8,10];
let target = 5;

console.log(binarySearch(arr, target)); // Output: 4
``` 

In this example, we are searching for the number `5` in the array `[3,6,9,1,8,10]`. The function returns the index of `5` which is 4 in this case.

Note: Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the array into two halves until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the array. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the array is empty.
