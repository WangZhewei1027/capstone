    <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

    <p>Bubble Sort is an algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements, swapping them if they are not in order. It works by starting at the beginning of the list (the smallest element), moving to the middle (which is usually the second-to-last element), and then moving back to the beginning of the list (the largest element). This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.</p>

    <script>
      function bubbleSort(arr) {
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
          let j = i + 1;

          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
            // swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
            arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j];
          }
        }
      }

      // example usage
      const array = [5,3,8,1,2,9,7,6];
      bubbleSort(array);
      console.log(array); // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
