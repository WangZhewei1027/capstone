It works by starting at the beginning of the list (the smallest element), moving to the middle (which is usually the second-to-last element), and then moving back to the beginning of the list (the largest element). This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.</p>\n\n    <script>\n      function bubbleSort(arr) {\n        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {\n          let j = i + 1;\n\n          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n            // swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n            arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j];\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n      // example usage\n      const array = [5,3,8,1,2,9,7,6];\n      bubbleSort(array);\n      console.log(array); // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>"
