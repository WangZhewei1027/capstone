It works by repeatedly iterating over the list until no more swaps are needed, at which point the list is sorted.</p>\n\nHere's an example implementation of Bubble Sort:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bubbleSort(arr) {\n  let len = arr.length;\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {\n      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n        // swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n        let temp = arr[j];\n        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n        arr[j + 1] = temp;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconsole.log(bubbleSort([3,6,8,9])); // Output: [3,6,8,9]\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first define a function called `bubbleSort` that takes a list as input. We then initialize the length of the array to be the size of the input list minus one.\n\nWe use nested loops to iterate over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element. For each iteration, we compare the current element with its adjacent element using a `>` operator. If the current element is greater than its next element, we swap them using the `temp` variable.\n\nAfter all the iterations have been completed, the array will be sorted in ascending order. In this example, we pass the array `[3,6,8,9]` to the `bubbleSort` function, which returns the sorted array `[3,6,8,9]`."
