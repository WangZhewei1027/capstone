<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

<p>Bubble Sort is an algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list of elements, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It works by repeatedly iterating over the list until no more swaps are needed, at which point the list is sorted.</p>

Here's an example implementation of Bubble Sort:

```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let len = arr.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        // swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
        let temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
console.log(bubbleSort([3,6,8,9])); // Output: [3,6,8,9]
```

In this implementation, we first define a function called `bubbleSort` that takes a list as input. We then initialize the length of the array to be the size of the input list minus one.

We use nested loops to iterate over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element. For each iteration, we compare the current element with its adjacent element using a `>` operator. If the current element is greater than its next element, we swap them using the `temp` variable.

After all the iterations have been completed, the array will be sorted in ascending order. In this example, we pass the array `[3,6,8,9]` to the `bubbleSort` function, which returns the sorted array `[3,6,8,9]`.
