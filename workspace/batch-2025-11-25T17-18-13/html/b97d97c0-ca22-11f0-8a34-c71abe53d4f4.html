<h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>

<p>Binary search tree is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of elements within an array or collection. It is implemented as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Node:</strong> A node represents an element in the binary search tree. Each node has two children: left child and right child.
		<li><strong>Left Child:</strong> The left child of a node is one less than the parent node and has no children.
		<li><strong>Right Child:</strong> The right child of a node is one more than the parent node and has one child.
		<li><strong>Element:</strong> The value of the current node.
	</ul>

<p>The insert operation inserts an element at a specific position in the tree. If the element already exists in the tree, it is not inserted. Otherwise, it is added to the left or right subtree according to the given comparison operator.</p>

<p>The delete operation removes an element from the tree. If the element does not exist in the tree, it is not deleted. Otherwise, it is removed from the left or right subtree according to the given comparison operator.</p>

<p>The search operation searches for an element in the tree. If the element does not exist in the tree, it is not searched. Otherwise, it is searched for the specified comparison operator.</p>

<p>The print operation displays all the nodes in the tree in order of their values.</p>

<p>Pricing: Binary search trees are usually used for storing large amounts of data and require careful management to ensure their efficiency and security. They can be found in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Additionally, they can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and hash tables.</p>
