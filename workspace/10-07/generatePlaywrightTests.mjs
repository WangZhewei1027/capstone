You are an expert software QA engineer specializing in interactive visualization testing using Playwright.

Your task is to generate a **complete Playwright test file (.spec.js)** to evaluate the **functional correctness, robustness, and performance** of an educational visualization HTML file.

The test should comprehensively assess the visualization‚Äôs behavior for the given **concept** and **HTML source**.

---

### üîç INPUT CONTEXT

Concept name: "${conceptName}"

HTML file path: "${htmlPath}"

HTML contents:
\`\`\`html
${htmlContent}
\`\`\`

---

### üéØ YOUR GOAL
Generate a single Playwright test file that evaluates the visualization on **10 specific metrics** of functional correctness, interactivity, and robustness:

1. **initial_render_correct (bool)** ‚Äî Verify that key visual elements (e.g., bars, nodes, points, or axes) exist and that their attributes or data correspond to the initial data configuration.

2. **control_presence (bool / list)** ‚Äî Ensure essential UI controls (buttons, sliders, dropdowns) exist and are interactable. For example, ‚ÄúSort‚Äù, ‚ÄúStart‚Äù, ‚ÄúReset‚Äù, or ‚ÄúAdjust Array Size‚Äù if conceptually relevant.

3. **final_sorted (bool)** ‚Äî If applicable (sorting, optimization, convergence), check that the visualization reaches a correct final state (e.g., sorted array, converged gradient).

4. **stepwise_progression (percent / snapshots)** ‚Äî Detect whether the DOM changes progressively between states (e.g., swaps, iterations). Collect intermediate snapshots.

5. **swap_count (number)** ‚Äî Estimate number of swap/iteration updates based on DOM or data changes.

6. **time_to_sort_ms (number)** ‚Äî Measure elapsed time from start of visualization to completion.

7. **console_errors (count)** ‚Äî Count console errors and warnings during execution.

8. **idempotency (bool)** ‚Äî Clicking the main control again on a finished visualization should not crash or change results incorrectly.

9. **robustness_under_rapid_clicks (bool / count)** ‚Äî Rapidly trigger the main action multiple times; verify no crashes, consistent output, and final correctness.

10. **visual_regression_hash (string)** ‚Äî Capture a before/after screenshot pair and compute or log a placeholder hash (e.g., MD5 or text placeholder) for future comparison.

---

### üß© FILE STRUCTURE

The output should be a **single Playwright spec file** named according to the concept, e.g.:

\`\`\`js
// tests/${conceptName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, "-")}.spec.js
\`\`\`

Follow this format:

\`\`\`js
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

const FILE_URL = "file://" + process.cwd() + "${htmlPath}";

// Helper functions: getHeights(), isSorted(), etc.
// BeforeEach: navigate to page, optionally speed up animations.
// Then implement 9-10 Playwright tests corresponding to the metrics above.
// Include console logging for duration, swap count, and screenshot hash.

test.describe("${conceptName} Visualization Evaluation", () => {
  ...
});
\`\`\`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES
- Assume the HTML may be imperfect. Do not skip a test if missing controls; instead, **log that they are missing**.
- Handle different visualization types: bars, SVGs, canvases, or dynamic text.
- Prefer robust selectors (by id, class, or role).
- Use async Playwright syntax.
- Do not output explanations ‚Äî only the **final Playwright code**.

---
Now generate the complete Playwright test file.
