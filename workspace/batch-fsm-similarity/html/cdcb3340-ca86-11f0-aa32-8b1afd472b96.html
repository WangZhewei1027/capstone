	<h1>Prim's Algorithm</h1>
	
	<p>Welcome to Prim's Algorithm! This algorithm is named after the mathematician who developed it, George V. Pragmatik. The algorithm involves two steps:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list.</li>
		<li>Divide the GCD by each number and repeat step 2 until no more dividing operations are needed.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The output of Prim's Algorithm is a single number that is the GCD of all the numbers in the list. If there are any remaining numbers left in the list, they are returned as an array of prime numbers.</p>
