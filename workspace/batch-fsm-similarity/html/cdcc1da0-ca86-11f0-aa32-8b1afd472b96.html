Here's an example of a simple recursive function in JavaScript that calculates the factorial of a given number:
```
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1;
  else return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. It works by calling itself recursively with the argument `n-1`, until it reaches the base case of `n=0` or `n=1`, at which point the function returns `1`.
To use this function, you can call it like this:
```javascript
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

Note that recursion can be a complex and elegant way to solve problems, but it can also lead to stack overflow errors if the function calls itself too many times. It's important to consider these potential issues when designing recursive functions.
