	<h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>
	<p>Imagine a binary search tree where each node has two child nodes: one for data and one for left subtree. When you search for a specific value, it will start at the root node and then move down to the left subtree until it finds the target value.</p>
	<h2>Example Node:</h2>
	<p>The following is an example of a Node object:</p>
	<div class="node">
		<td>Value 1</td>
		<td>Data 1</td>
	</div>
	<h2>Search Result:</h2>
	<p>The value '7' was found at the position 3, so the result is:</p>
	<p><span class="result">Value 3</span></p>
