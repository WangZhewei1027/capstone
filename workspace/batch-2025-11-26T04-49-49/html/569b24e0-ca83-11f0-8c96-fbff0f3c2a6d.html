<h1>Red-Black Tree</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Red-Black Tree! It is an algorithm that allows you to find the shortest path between two nodes in a tree.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

  * The node with the lowest value (the root) is called the "root."
  * For each unvisited node, its children are added to a list of visited nodes.
  * If a node has no children, the current node becomes the new root.
  * If a node has at least one child, the current node's children are added to the list of visited nodes and the parent node is updated to be the new root.

  * To find the shortest path from node A to node B, we can use the following steps:

    1. Start at node B.
    2. Go to node A by following the path from node A to node B.
    3. Return the path from node B to node A.

Here's some sample code to implement this algorithm in JavaScript:
```javascript
function redBlackTree(root) {
    let path = [];
    let visited = new Array(root.size).fill(false);

    for (let i = 0; i < root.size; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            visited[i] = true;
            path.push(i);
        }
    }

    return path;
}

console.log(redBlackTree('A')); // [0]
console.log(redBlackTree('B')); // [1]
console.log(redBlackTree('C')); // [2]
```

This code defines a function `redBlackTree` that takes a node as input and returns the shortest path from that node to the specified target node. It initializes an empty array `path` to store the paths, and a boolean array `visited` to keep track of whether the node has been visited before. It then loops through all the nodes in the tree using a `for` loop, adding each node to the `visited` array. Once the loop completes, the `path` array contains the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.

Finally, the code logs the shortest path to the console using the `console.log()` function.
