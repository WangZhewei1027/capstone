<h1>Hash Map</h1>

<p>Here is an example of a simple hash map:</p>

```javascript
const myMap = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
};

console.log(myMap); // { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }
```

In this example, we have defined a `myMap` object that contains three key-value pairs. The keys are "name", "age", and "city". The values are simply assigned to these keys using string interpolation.

You can use this hash map in your code like this:

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    city: "Chicago"
};

console.log(person); // { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Chicago' }
```

This will output the same result as the previous example, which shows that the `myMap` object has three key-value pairs with the corresponding values in the format "name: [value1], age: [value2], city: [value3]".
