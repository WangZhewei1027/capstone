<h1>Kruskal's Algorithm</h1>

<p>The Kruskal's algorithm is a sorting algorithm used to efficiently find the k-th smallest element in an array. The algorithm works by repeatedly adding the kth element to the end of the array and then finding the minimum value among all elements that have been added so far. It takes O(n log n) time for each iteration.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the algorithm is to keep track of the maximum value seen so far and update it if the current element has become smaller than the previous maximum. This process is repeated until the final element is found, which will be the k-th smallest element.</p>

Here is an example implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
function knuthSort(arr) {
    let k = arr.length - 1;
    
    // Keep track of the maximum value seen so far
    let max = arr[0];
    
    // Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element
    for (let i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // Update the maximum value if the current element has become smaller than the previous maximum
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    
    // Find the k-th smallest element
    return arr[k];
}

// Example usage
console.log(knuthSort([3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 4, 5])); // Output: 3
```

In this implementation, we define a function `knuthSort` that takes an array as input and returns its k-th smallest element. We initialize the `k` variable to the length of the array minus one, and then iterate through the array from the second element to the last element using a `for` loop. In each iteration, we update the `max` variable if the current element has become smaller than the previous maximum, and then check if the current element is less than or equal to `max`. If it is, we update `max` to be the current element. Finally, we find the k-th smallest element by returning `max`.

Note that the `knuthSort` function assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order. If the array is not sorted in ascending order, the function may not produce the expected result.
