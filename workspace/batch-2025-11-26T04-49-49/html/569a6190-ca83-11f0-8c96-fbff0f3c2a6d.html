	<h1>Binary Tree</h1>
	<p>There are two types of trees: Binary Trees and Non-Binary Trees. A Binary Tree is a tree where each node has at most one child and each child node can only have one parent. On the other hand, a Non-Binary Tree is a tree where each node has at least two children and each child node can have at least three children.</p>
	<h2>Example of Binary Tree:</h2>
	<p>A binary tree consists of the following nodes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>root</li>
		<li>left child</li>
		<li>right child</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This tree has 5 nodes (root, left, right, and root). The values in the left subtree are 3, 7, and 9 respectively. The values in the right subtree are -6 and 0 respectively. The values in the middle subtree are 1 and 4 respectively.</p>
	<h2>Example of Non-Binary Tree:</h2>
	<p>A non-binary tree consists of the following nodes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>root</li>
		<li>left child</li>
		<li>right child</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This tree has 7 nodes (root, left, right, and root). The values in the left subtree are 3, 8, 12, 16, and 19 respectively. The values in the right subtree are -3, 10, 15, 21, and 26 respectively. The values in the middle subtree are 2, 5, 7, 11, and 17 respectively.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
	<p>The binary tree and non-binary tree are two different types of trees. Binary trees are used to represent the structure and relationships between elements in a collection, while non-binary trees are used to represent the structure and relationships between elements in a collection without any relationship between them.</p>
