      - text: is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue, but where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities. Priority queues are often implemented using heaps and have various applications such as in Dijkstra's algorithm, Huffman coding, and job scheduling.
