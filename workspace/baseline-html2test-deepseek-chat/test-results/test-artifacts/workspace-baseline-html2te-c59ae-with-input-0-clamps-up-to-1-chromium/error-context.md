    - heading "About the Fibonacci Sequence" [level=2] [ref=e27]
    - paragraph [ref=e28]: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
    - paragraph [ref=e29]: "Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..."
    - paragraph [ref=e30]: This sequence appears in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, and the flowering of an artichoke.
    - paragraph [ref=e31]: The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618), which is considered aesthetically pleasing and appears in art, architecture, and nature.
