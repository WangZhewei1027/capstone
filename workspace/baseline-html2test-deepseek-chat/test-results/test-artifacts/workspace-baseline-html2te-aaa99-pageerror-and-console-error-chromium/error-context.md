      - paragraph [ref=e42]: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. It's based on the principle that similar things exist in close proximity.
      - paragraph [ref=e44]:

        - text: The class of a new data point is determined by the classes of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

          - paragraph [ref=e50]: Select the number of neighbors (K) to consider. A small K value makes the algorithm sensitive to noise, while a large K value makes it more stable but possibly less accurate.

          - paragraph [ref=e62]: For classification, assign the class that appears most frequently among the K neighbors. For regression, take the average of the neighbors' values.
