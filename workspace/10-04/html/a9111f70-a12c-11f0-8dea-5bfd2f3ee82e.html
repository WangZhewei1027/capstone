Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Bubble Sort algorithm works:

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two adjacent elements.
   - If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.
4. Continue this process for the entire list; after each pass, the largest unsorted element will 'bubble up' to its correct position.
5. Repeat the process for the entire list until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted.

### Example:

Consider the following list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.

**Pass 1:**
- Compare 5 and 3: swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`
- Compare 5 and 8: no swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`
- Compare 8 and 4: swap → `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`
- Compare 8 and 2: swap → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`

**Pass 2:**
- Compare 3 and 5: no swap → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`
- Compare 5 and 4: swap → `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`
- Compare 5 and 2: swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
- Compare 5 and 8: no swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`

**Pass 3:**
- Compare 3 and 4: no swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
- Compare 4 and 2: swap → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
- Compare 4 and 5: no swap → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
- Compare 5 and 8: no swap → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

**Pass 4:**
- Compare 3 and 2: swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
- Compare 3 and 4: no swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
- Compare 4 and 5: no swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
- Compare 5 and 8: no swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`

Now the list is sorted: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### Pseudo Code:

Here's a simple pseudo code for Bubble Sort:

```
function bubbleSort(array):
    n = length(array)
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from 0 to n-i-2:
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap(array[j], array[j+1])
```

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, where n is the number of items being sorted. O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because it only requires a small amount of additional memory space.

Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort is generally not suitable for large datasets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high compared to more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort.
