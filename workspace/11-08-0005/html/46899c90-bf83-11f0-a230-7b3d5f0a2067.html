# Interactive Binary Search Module Design

## Concept Title
**Binary Search: Divide and Conquer**

## Learning Objective
Users will understand how binary search efficiently finds elements in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, visualizing the algorithm's O(log n) time complexity through interactive exploration.

## Interaction Design

### User Interactions:
1. **Array Generation**: Click "Generate New Array" to create a random sorted array of 15-20 elements
2. **Target Selection**: Type a number in the search input field to set the target value
3. **Search Control**: 
   - Click "Start Search" to begin the algorithm
   - Click "Step Forward" to advance one comparison at a time
   - Click "Auto Play" to watch the algorithm run automatically with smooth animations
   - Click "Reset" to return to initial state
4. **Speed Control**: Drag a slider to adjust animation speed (100ms - 1000ms per step)

### Visual Feedback:
- **Array Visualization**: Each element displayed as a colored box with the number inside
- **Pointer Indicators**: Animated arrows showing left, right, and mid positions
- **Search Space Highlighting**: Active search range highlighted in light blue, excluded elements grayed out
- **Comparison Animation**: Current mid element pulses and scales up during comparison
- **Result Feedback**: Found element glows green, not found shows red pulse on final search space
- **Step Counter**: Shows current step number and total comparisons made
- **Comparison Visualization**: Shows the current comparison (target vs mid) with <, >, or = symbols

### State Changes:
- Real-time updating of left/right boundaries
- Progressive graying out of eliminated array sections
- Smooth transitions between search steps
- Clear indication of algorithm termination

### Design Principles:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Title → Array → Controls → Status → Explanation
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox layout adapts to different screen sizes
- **Consistent Spacing**: 16px minimum between all interactive elements
- **Safe Margins**: 24px padding on all viewport edges
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Active search space: Light blue (#E3F2FD)
  - Current mid element: Yellow pulse (#FFD54F)
  - Found element: Green (#4CAF50)
  - Excluded elements: Gray (#BDBDBD)
  - Pointers: Dark blue (#1976D2)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with appropriate sizing
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, keyboard navigation support, ARIA labels

This design creates an engaging, educational experience that makes the binary search algorithm's efficiency visible and intuitive through step-by-step visualization and user control.
