## Interactive Design Plan: Weighted Graph Explorer

### Concept Title:
**Understanding Weighted Graphs Through Interactive Path Finding**

### Learning Objective:
Users will understand how weighted graphs represent networks with different connection costs, learn to identify shortest paths considering edge weights, and visualize how algorithms like Dijkstra's work to find optimal routes between nodes.

### Interaction Design:
The interface presents an interactive graph visualization where users can:

1. **Click and drag nodes** to reposition them, helping users arrange the graph for better visibility
2. **Click on edges** to modify their weights using a popup input
3. **Select source and destination nodes** by clicking them (first click = source in green, second click = destination in red)
4. **Press "Find Shortest Path" button** to animate Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Visited nodes pulse and change color progressively
   - Current edge being examined highlights in yellow
   - Final shortest path animates in green with total cost displayed
5. **Add new nodes** by double-clicking empty space
6. **Add new edges** by clicking "Add Edge Mode" then clicking two nodes sequentially
7. **Reset the graph** to return to the initial example configuration

Visual feedback includes:
- Hover effects on nodes and edges with subtle scaling
- Smooth transitions when dragging nodes (connected edges follow dynamically)
- Color-coded states: unvisited (blue), visiting (yellow), visited (light blue), shortest path (green)
- Animated distance labels that update as the algorithm progresses
- Edge weights displayed at midpoints with contrasting background for readability

### Layout Description:
The page uses a clean, focused layout:

- **Header section** (top 24px margin): Contains the title and brief instruction text
- **Control panel** (left side, 24px margin): 
  - Algorithm control buttons (Find Path, Reset, Clear Selection)
  - Mode toggle (Normal/Add Edge)
  - Current path cost display
  - Legend showing node/edge states
- **Main canvas area** (center, with 24px safe margins):
  - SVG canvas for graph visualization (responsive, maintains aspect ratio)
  - Nodes are initially arranged in a balanced layout
  - Edge weights displayed at midpoints
  - Sufficient spacing (minimum 100px) between nodes for clarity
- **Info panel** (right side, 24px margin):
  - Displays step-by-step algorithm progress
  - Shows current distances from source
  - Updates in real-time during animation

All interactive elements maintain 16px minimum spacing, use clear visual hierarchy with consistent color coding, and include hover states for better affordance. The design is responsive, scaling appropriately while maintaining readability on different screen sizes.
