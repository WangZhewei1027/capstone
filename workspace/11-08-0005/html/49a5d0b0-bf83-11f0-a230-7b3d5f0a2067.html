# Interactive Red-Black Tree Design Plan

## Concept Title
**Red-Black Tree: Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree**

## Learning Objective
Users will understand how Red-Black Trees maintain balance through color-based rules and rotations by:
- Visualizing the five fundamental properties of Red-Black Trees
- Interactively inserting nodes and observing automatic rebalancing
- Seeing how color changes and rotations preserve tree balance
- Understanding why Red-Black Trees guarantee O(log n) operations

## Interaction Design

### User Interactions:
1. **Node Insertion**: 
   - Users type a number in an input field and click "Insert"
   - The tree animates the insertion process step-by-step
   - Shows BST insertion first, then color assignment, then any necessary rotations/recoloring

2. **Step-by-Step Mode**:
   - Toggle switch for automatic vs. manual progression
   - In manual mode, users click "Next Step" to see each phase of insertion
   - Each step highlights the relevant nodes and shows explanatory text

3. **Property Verification**:
   - Hovering over any node shows its black-height
   - A sidebar displays real-time verification of all five RB-Tree properties
   - Properties that would be violated flash red before fixes are applied

4. **Interactive Examples**:
   - Preset scenarios buttons (e.g., "Trigger Left Rotation", "Trigger Recoloring")
   - Users can click these to see specific balancing operations

5. **Tree Manipulation**:
   - Click any node to see its properties (color, value, depth, black-height)
   - "Clear Tree" button to start over
   - "Random Tree" button to generate a valid RB-Tree with 10-15 nodes

### Visual Feedback:
- **Color Coding**: Red nodes are bright red (#DC143C), Black nodes are dark (#2C3E50)
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for rotations (0.5s), color changes (0.3s), and node movements
- **Highlighting**: Currently processing nodes glow with a pulse animation
- **Path Tracing**: When showing black-height, the path lights up from node to leaves
- **Violation Indicators**: Dotted red outlines appear around nodes that violate properties
