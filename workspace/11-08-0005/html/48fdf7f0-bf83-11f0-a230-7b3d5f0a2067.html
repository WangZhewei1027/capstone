# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Interactive Design Plan

## Concept Title
**"K-Nearest Neighbors: Classification by Proximity"**

## Learning Objective
Users will understand how the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm classifies new data points by:
- Visualizing how distance measurements determine nearest neighbors
- Experimenting with different K values to see how it affects classification decisions
- Understanding the "majority vote" principle through interactive exploration
- Recognizing how the choice of K impacts decision boundaries and classification results

## Interaction Design

### User Interactions:
1. **Click to Place New Points**: Users can click anywhere on the canvas to place a new point that needs classification
2. **Adjust K Value**: A slider allows users to change K from 1 to 15, instantly updating the classification
3. **Toggle Distance Visualization**: A checkbox shows/hides distance circles to the K nearest neighbors
4. **Add Training Data**: Users can click buttons to add pre-classified training points (Class A or Class B)
5. **Clear and Reset**: Buttons to clear the canvas or reset to default training data

### Visual Feedback and Animations:
1. **Distance Circles**: Animated expanding circles show the search radius growing until K neighbors are found
2. **Neighbor Highlighting**: The K nearest neighbors pulse with a gentle glow effect
3. **Classification Animation**: The new point smoothly transitions to its predicted class color
4. **Voting Visualization**: A small bar chart animates to show the vote count from each class
5. **Decision Boundary Preview**: As users hover, a ghost preview shows how the point would be classified at that location

### State Changes:
- New points start as gray (unclassified) then animate to their predicted class color
- Distance lines dynamically connect the query point to its K nearest neighbors
- The vote counter updates in real-time as K changes
- Training points can be dragged to new positions, triggering reclassification

### Key Design Elements:

1. **Canvas Area** (Left, 65% width):
   - White background with subtle grid lines
   - Minimum 500px × 500px, scales responsively
   - Contains all data points and visualizations

2. **Control Panel** (Top, full width):
   - Horizontally arranged controls with 16px spacing
   - K-value slider with live numeric display
   - Toggle switches use clear visual states

3. **Vote Display** (Right sidebar, 30% width):
   - Real-time animated bar chart
   - Large, clear prediction result
   - Updates smoothly as K changes

4. **Legend Box** (Right sidebar, below vote display):
   - Color-coded class indicators
   - Clear, accessible typography

### Visual Hierarchy:
- **Primary Focus**: The canvas area where interaction happens
- **Secondary Focus**: K-value control and vote display
- **Supporting Elements**: Legend and additional controls

### Responsive Considerations:
- On smaller screens (<768px), sidebar elements stack below the canvas
- Touch-friendly hit areas (minimum 44px × 44px)
- Canvas scales while maintaining aspect ratio
- Controls remain accessible and properly spaced

This design creates an intuitive, educational experience that makes the KNN algorithm's decision-making process visible and interactive, helping users build mental models through experimentation.
