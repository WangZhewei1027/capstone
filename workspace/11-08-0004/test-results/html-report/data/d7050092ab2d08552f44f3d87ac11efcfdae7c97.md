        - generic [ref=e64]: Use Delete to remove selection. Select a node then use arrow keys to nudge (focus canvas first).
  - region "Design plan" [ref=e65]:
    - heading "Concept Title" [level=3] [ref=e66]
    - paragraph [ref=e67]: "Graph: Directed vs Undirected — visualize differences, create edges, and observe how adjacency changes."
    - heading "Learning Objective" [level=3] [ref=e68]
    - paragraph [ref=e69]: After interacting, users will understand how directed edges differ from undirected edges visually and structurally (how adjacency lists/matrices reflect direction), and gain intuition by building small examples.
    - heading "Interaction Design" [level=3] [ref=e70]
    - list [ref=e71]:
      - listitem [ref=e72]: Double-click the canvas to create nodes. Drag nodes to reposition them. Clicking or dragging from node-to-node creates edges.
      - listitem [ref=e73]: Toggle "Directed" — edges gain arrowheads and adjacency becomes directional. Transition animations visually emphasize the change (edges draw when created; arrowheads scale in/out when mode changes).
      - listitem [ref=e74]: Select nodes or edges to inspect or delete them. The adjacency list updates live so users immediately see the structural effect of directed vs undirected edges.
      - listitem [ref=e75]: These interactions use pointer events for smooth dragging, and keyboard accessibility (Delete to remove, arrow keys to nudge nodes).
    - heading "Layout Description" [level=3] [ref=e76]
    - paragraph [ref=e77]: "Two-column layout: a large SVG canvas (left) for drawing and interaction, and a right sidebar with controls, adjacency display, and instructions. Safe area margin of 24px surrounds the app; interactive elements use at least 16px spacing. The SVG is responsive and scalable; on small screens the sidebar stacks below the canvas to maintain focus and balance. Controls are grouped and labeled for accessibility, with aria-live regions for adjacency and mode updates."
