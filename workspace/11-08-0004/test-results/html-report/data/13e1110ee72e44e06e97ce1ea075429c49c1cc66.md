      - heading "Learning Objective" [level=3] [ref=e6]
      - paragraph [ref=e7]: Understand what a weighted graph is and how edge weights represent costs or distances. Interactively build a graph, assign weights, and see visually how weights change which path between two nodes is "cheaper".
    - region "Interaction Design" [ref=e8]:
      - heading "Interaction Design" [level=3] [ref=e9]
      - paragraph [ref=e10]: "Modes: Add, Connect, Move, Delete, and Select Source/Target. Click on the canvas in Add mode to create nodes. In Connect mode click a source node and then a target to create an edge — you'll be prompted to set its weight. Drag nodes to reposition; edges update in real time. Double-click an edge to edit its weight with a slider. Choose source and target nodes then press \"Find cheapest path\" to animate exploration and highlight the final lowest-cost route."

      - paragraph [ref=e13]: "The left panel (this one) holds explanatory text and controls (stacked with at least 16px gaps). The right panel is the interactive canvas (SVG) with a top bar for status and buttons beneath. Safe area margins of 24px are preserved; interactive elements have a minimum spacing of 16px. The layout is responsive: on narrow screens the explanation stacks above the canvas."
