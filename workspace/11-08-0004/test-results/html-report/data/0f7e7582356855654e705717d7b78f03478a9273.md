  - banner [ref=e3]:
    - heading "Adjacency Matrix — Visualizing Graphs as Matrices" [level=1] [ref=e5]
    - generic [ref=e6]: See how a graph maps to its adjacency matrix. Create nodes, add edges, drag nodes — the matrix updates live. Click matrix cells to highlight the corresponding edge.

          - strong [ref=e11]: Interactive Graph
          - generic [ref=e12]: Click inside the area to add a node (max 8). Click one node then another to toggle an edge.

      - generic [ref=e33]: Module ready. Click inside the canvas to add a node.

        - generic [ref=e37]:
          - strong [ref=e38]: Learning Objective
          - generic [ref=e39]: Understand how a graph's edges correspond to entries in an adjacency matrix. Observe symmetry for undirected graphs and asymmetry for directed graphs.
        - generic [ref=e42]: No nodes yet. Add nodes by clicking the canvas.
        - generic [ref=e43]:
          - generic [ref=e44]: Cell = 1 if an edge exists from row-node -> column-node
          - generic [ref=e45]: Click a cell to toggle and highlight

          - strong [ref=e48]: Interaction Design
          - generic [ref=e49]:
            - text: "- The left area is an interactive graph. Adding and connecting nodes updates the matrix on the right in real time."
            - text: "- When the graph is undirected, the matrix is symmetric: toggling edge (A,B) sets both M[A][B] and M[B][A]."
            - text: "- Clicking a matrix cell highlights the corresponding edge and nodes in the graph with a brief animation, reinforcing the correspondence."
        - generic [ref=e50]:
          - strong [ref=e51]: Layout Description
          - generic [ref=e52]:
            - text: "- Safe area: 24px padding around the viewport. Elements use at least 16px spacing via CSS gaps."
            - text: "- Two-column layout on wider screens: left shows graph canvas (primary focus), right shows matrix and guidance."
            - text: "- Responsive: stacked on small screens; interactive elements are large enough for touch and keyboard accessible (tabindex on nodes and cells, Enter toggles)."
  - contentinfo [ref=e53]: Built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no libraries. Explore adjacency matrices by experimenting with small graphs.
