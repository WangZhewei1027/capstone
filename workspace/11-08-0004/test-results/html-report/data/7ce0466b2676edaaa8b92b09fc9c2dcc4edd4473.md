- main "Adjacency Matrix interactive module" [ref=e2]:
  - generic [ref=e3]:
    - heading "Adjacency Matrix — Visual & Interactive Exploration" [level=1] [ref=e4]
    - paragraph [ref=e5]: Interactively build a graph and observe its adjacency matrix (and vice versa). Drag nodes, toggle edges, and watch the matrix update in real time.
  - 'region "How to interact: Click \"Add Node\" to create nodes. Click one node then another to toggle an edge (shift-click to create directed edge regardless of toggle). Drag nodes to rearrange. You can also click matrix cells on the right to toggle edges." [ref=e6]':

  - complementary "Learning Objective" [ref=e19]:
    - generic [ref=e20]:
      - heading "Learning Objective" [level=3] [ref=e21]
      - paragraph [ref=e22]: "After interacting, you'll understand how a graph's adjacency matrix encodes which vertices are connected: each row/column pair corresponds to source/target, and a cell value of 1 means an edge exists between the two vertices."
    - generic [ref=e23]:
      - heading "Interaction Design (summary)" [level=3] [ref=e24]
      - paragraph [ref=e25]: Click nodes to toggle edges; click or keyboard-focus matrix cells to toggle the corresponding adjacency entry. The graph and matrix update instantly and highlight corresponding nodes/cells during mouse hover. In undirected mode, toggling one cell updates the symmetric cell.
    - generic [ref=e26]:
      - heading "Adjacency Matrix (click cells to toggle)" [level=3] [ref=e27]
      - table [ref=e30]:
        - rowgroup [ref=e31]:
          - row [ref=e32]:
            - cell [ref=e33]
        - rowgroup
    - generic [ref=e34]:
      - heading "Layout Description" [level=3] [ref=e35]
      - paragraph [ref=e36]: Canvas at left shows the graph; controls above canvas; matrix and explanatory text on the right. Safe margins are 24px, and interactive elements maintain a minimum 16px spacing to ensure clarity. The interface is responsive — on narrow screens the matrix stacks below the canvas.
  - generic [ref=e37]: "Interaction tips: Use keyboard to focus matrix cells (Tab), press Space/Enter to toggle. Use Shift-click on nodes to force directed edge creation even when \"Directed\" is off."
